Collect videos and webcam recordings from your website's visitors.

Supports uploading videos to the WordPress Media Gallery, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Drive, and YouTube.

== Description ==

The Clipchamp Video Uploader and Webcam Recorder adds the features of the [Clipchamp API](https://clipchamp.com/getthebutton) to your WordPress-based website.

By adding the Clipchamp short code to your WordPress posts and pages, you will be able to collect videos from your website's visitors or let them make webcam recordings. 

The Clipchamp API will then compress and convert these videos into one of the supported video formats (MP4, WebM, WMV, FLV, GIF)
and upload them to one of the supported upload targets (WordPress Media Gallery, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Drive, YouTube).

Unlike any other webcam recorder and video uploader, Clipchamp is based purely on HTML5, using the cutting-edge of modern web technologies. 

It also compresses all videos and converts them into 1 standard format of your choice *before* they get uploaded to you. This reduces or even eliminates the need for server-side transcoding and involved costs.

All videos get sent directly to you and are neither processed on nor routed through Clipchamp servers, preserving your users' privacy. We [never have access](https://help.clipchamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/215476938-Does-Clipchamp-have-access-to-my-users-videos-) to your users' videos.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I do with the Clipchamp Video Uploader and Webcam Recorder plugin? =

This plugin lets you embed a button on your WordPress-based website that your visitors can click to either 1) record videos and upload to you or 2) upload video files they already have on their device. The plugin comes with a number of resolution (incl. 480p, 720p, 1080p), format (incl. MP4 and WebM) and compression (5 levels) options.

= How is the Clipchamp Video Uploader and Webcam recorder plugin different from a plain file uploader? =

Your users' video files get compressed & converted on the client before they get uploaded to you. As a result, you'll get much smaller files in 1 standard format of your choice (MP4, WebM, FLV,...). This dramatically reduces or even eliminates the huge costs involved in server-side video transcoding.

= Do my users' videos go through Clipchamp servers? =

No, all videos your users create get processed on your website visitors' client devices and uploaded from there straight to you. Clipchamp never sees or touches the files, you're in full control. Your users can thus safely submit any type of video to you - such as interview pitches, auditions, competition entries, feedback or educational videos.

= Is the Clipchamp technology purely based on HTML5? =

Yes, your users do not require Adobe Flash or other technologies for Clipchamp to work on their devices when visiting your website.

= Does this plugin work on mobile devices? =

Yes, it works across desktop and mobile versions of your website or web app and your users can create and upload videos on desktop and mobile devices. Content they create gets uploaded to your cloud storage.
